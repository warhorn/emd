# Embedded Markdown [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/emd.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/emd)

Embedded Markdown supports Markdown in Rails views and syntax highlighting at your Markdown code block.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'coderay' #optional for Syntax Highlighting
gem 'redcarpet'
gem 'emd'
```

And then execute:

```
bundle
```
## Usage

### Use it in a Markdown view `markdown.html.md`

1. Create a `markdown.html.md` view at `app/view/home/markdown.html.md` and add the following Markdown code:

```markdown
## This is a sample Markdown code
- [google](http://google.com)
- [emd](https://github.com/ytbryan/emd/)
```

1. Generate a home controller using the following command `rails generate controller home`

1. Add the following line to `route.rb`: 
```
get '/markdown', to: 'home#markdown'
```
1. And finally, visit the Markdown view at [http://localhost:3000/markdown](http://localhost:3000/markdown)


### Use it in a Markdown partial `_component.html.md`

1. Create a `_component.html.md` partial at `app/view/home/_component.html.md`:

```markdown
### This is a component

- This is item 1
- This is iiem 2
- [This is a link to google] (http://google.com)
```

1. Use this partial using `<%= render "component" %>` within any view like at `home/index.html.erb`

1. Add the following line to `route.rb`: 
```
get '/home', to: 'home#index'
```
1. And finally, visit the Rails view with Markdown partial at [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home)


### Syntax Highlighting

To support syntax highlighting, add `coderay` to Gemfile as shown below: 

```ruby
gem 'coderay'
```
Remember to run `bundle install`. 

This will turn all the code block into:

```ruby
    ```ruby
        class Something
        end
    ```
```

```ruby
class Something
end
```

Also, you can enable inline code highlighting by adding `code` style to your `index.css`

```
code {
  background-color: rgba(27,31,35,.1);
  border-radius: 3px;
  font-size: 85%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: .2em .4em;
}
```

### Enable number lines in your markdown's code block

To display number lines in your code block, add `emd.js` in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`

```javascript
//= require emd
//= require_tree .
```

And add `emd.css` in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`

```css
*= require emd
*= require_self
```

### Changing the color of the code block

To change the color of the code block, please use the following css selector: 

```css
div.code pre {
  background-color: #fff;
}
```

The default color is `#eee`


### Control which extensions Redcarpet uses

`emd` assumes some sane redcarpet extension use (see redcarpets options [here](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet#and-its-like-really-simple-to-use) and [here](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet#darling-i-packed-you-a-couple-renderers-for-lunch)). If you need to overwrite these in your Rails app, create a file `config/initializers/markdown_template_handler.rb` to overwrite the defaults from [config/initializers/markdown_template_handler.rb](config/initializers/markdown_template_handler.rb) like this:

```
module MarkdownTemplateHandler
  def self.call(template)
    compiled_source = erb.call(template)
    %(Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML,
                             no_intra_emphasis:            true,
                             fenced_code_blocks:           true,
                             # I actually like that, so commented it out:
                             # disable_indented_code_blocks: true,
                             space_after_headers:          true,
                             prettify:                     true,
                             tables:                       true,
                             with_toc_data:                true,
                             autolink:                     true
                             ).render(begin;#{compiled_source};end).html_safe)
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

) for making emd possible


## TODO

- [x] Syntax highlighting 
- [x] Number lines in code block
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Scaffolders
- [ ] Example repo
- [ ] Add a copy button to the code block



## Benefits

EMD uses a Rails engine and a simple initializer to initiate a markdown template handler with the help of Redcarpet and syntax highlighting from Coderay.

The motivation is to reuse Markdown file in several of my Rails projects.

- üòä Reuse Markdown in Rails products
- üìù Allow copywriters & marketers to be involved in building your content easily 
- üìù Allows you to focus on the content instead of the webpage structure.  
- üôå Supports syntax highlighting via Coderay
